# SocialMiner
The text mining toolkit developed for making sentiment analysis and idea clustering for Chinese text. 

This python-based application is to mainly solve the two problems during your day-by-day social network browsing
Spend a lot of time reading your friend posts word by word in Facebook

-	to find something you’re interesting
-	to know about their emotional status.    

It is comprised of two parts – **a backend platform supporting REST interface** and **a frontend by PHP** to demonstrate the effects of sentiment analysis and idea clustering.

Check it out - [**the tutorial doc**]() for how you use Social Miner.



### Quick-start

You can run it on local or remote hosted environment like Amazon
What you need to do
-	Make sure you have [Python 2.7.8 or Anaconda 2.1.0](http://continuum.io/downloads), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) installed. 
-	Install all dependent packages by pip
-	Start your mongo database. 
-	Put the frontend with any http server
-	Simply start backend REST server (it support http server already) by the following command 

You can run or modify [*the shell script*]() to ease the booting process of the backend server. 

### Demo

You need to login your facebook first and then choose a friend from your friend list. After that, your friend posts will be sorted and display based on the topic they belong and on the left, the emoticons will be used to represent the emotional status of each post.

So far Social Miner only supports Chinese text. However, it's easy to alter segmentation for English or other language easily.
